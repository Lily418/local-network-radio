# Local Network Radio

I'm building an application to control and stream audio to a Smart Radio which:

- Supports Frontier Silicon API
- Can receive streaming audio via HTTP Protocol (Called Internet Radio by these devices)

Tested on a Roberts Revival iStream3L but this description likely fits other devices.

## Motivation

My device has Wi-Fi connectivity and supports streaming Spotify, Amazon Music and Deezer via the internet however there was no method that I could find to play my own music library via Wi-Fi. Bluetooth and USB are both options but Bluetooth audio quality can be poor and I wanted to be able to control the playback from other devices as I was accustomed to via Spotify's 'Connect to Device' feature.

## What this application is not

- This is **unsuitable for hosting an internet radio show** as it prioritises low latency over scaling or reliability over the internet. The server is designed to have one client connected and be ran over a local network. See [Icecast](https://icecast.org/) for this purpose.

## State of the project

This project is currently in a proof of concept stage ðŸš§

## Setting up custom internet radio channels on Frontier Silicon API

There are some instructions for setting up custom radio stations via Robert's radio station database partner and also how to access the Frontier Silicon dashboard.
